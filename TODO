Centered Headings in the sidebar, where are they set, and how to change to 
left-aligned?

The Icon placement in the facts and events tab is a bit messy, especially the 
edit/delete icons, but also the event icons. I would have liked to have them 
stacked vertically and the enclosing div floated right in the table cell, but 
the placement is hard-coded in includes/functions/functions_print_facts.php

The Charts:
It varies strongly how the chart title is styled in relation to the selection 
table - whether they are both included in the same table, or not.
