Modified version of the standard xenea theme for webtrees.

These are the main changes:

- All color definitions are moved from style.css to a new file colors.css.
  This makes it much easier to adjust colors, and to make adjustments
  consistent across page items.
- The color scheme uses blue and red nuances for person boxes only. A
  theme that uses blue for neutral elements seems to confirm that "it's a
  man's world". OK, it is, but it doesn't have to be emphasised.
- The look and feel is modernized. The webtrees layout is (still)
  table-based, but it doesn't have to look that way.
  NB: the theme uses the css3 property box-shadow, which is not recognized
  by all browsers (read: Internet Explorer and really old browsers). There
  are workarounds for these, and I may eventually incorporate them, but
  only after the theme passes from the development stage to the adjustment
  stage.
- Minor enhancements: 
  more logical placement of the color, theme and favorite menus; 
  the site name is a link to the front page; 
  personalized favicon (it's my grandfather; replace it with your own); 
  etc.

It's still very much a beta version. The colors.css file can still be
optimized a whole lot more, and there may be bugs that I've overlooked, so
take it for what it is. I welcome feedback and bug reports.

It can be seen in action on my own site, oestrem.com/webtrees.

The name: it's a "neo-xenea", and my anglicized initials are "eo"...
